code to clean ambed and convert user query to a binary file. The user submits a csv file and a column id (starting from 0)
the query column is extracted, cleaned (to only keep text data, remove special characters and numbers) and converted into embeddings. the result file is saved in uploads/bins. the query file is always names tOc1 (table id = 0 total column = 1). thus the uploads/bins foloder only contains 1 file for the last executed query.
